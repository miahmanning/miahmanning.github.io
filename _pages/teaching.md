Outreach
----------
**Zephyr Marine**

Beginning in September 2023 Miah began as a volunteer for [Zephyr Marine](https://zephyrmarine.com/), a program aimed at introducing k-12 students to ocean science. The program invites students out for a day boat ride where program director Rob Reynolds and volunteers help the students deploy niskin bottles, sediment traps, underwater carmeras, and investigate benthic invertebrates native to the Cape Cod area. Volunteers lead students on a tour of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution docks and Discovery Center. Miah enjoyed sharing her journey into oceanography to the students, answering the students' questions, and teaching the students about her own research and its applications to the local wildlife.

Outreach
----------
**Zephyr Marine**

<center><p align="center" style="max-width:50%;"><img src="../images/Miah 1.jpeg" /></p></center>

Beginning in September 2023, Miah began as a volunteer for [Zephyr Marine](https://zephyrmarine.com/), a program aimed at introducing k-12 students to ocean science. The program invites students out for a day boat ride where program director Rob Reynolds and volunteers help the students deploy niskin bottles, sediment traps, underwater carmeras, and investigate benthic invertebrates native to the Cape Cod area. Volunteers lead students on a tour of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution docks and Discovery Center. Miah enjoyed sharing her journey into oceanography to the students, answering the students' questions, and teaching the students about her own research and its applications to the local wildlife.

**Letters to a Pre-Scientist (LPS)**

Starting in September 2023, Miah began particiating in the [Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/) (LPS) pen-pal program. LPS connects fifth through tenth grade students in low-income communities with STEM professionals through snail mail. Often, the students are paired with professionals that do not fit a stereotypical image of a scientist. Through exchanging letters, the students and scientists describe the higher education pathway and STEM career journey as well as personal obstacles, solutions, and even some fun facts! Miah believes this program is a great way to reach students beyond the Cape Cod area and to engage in thoughtful communication with young people about what careers in STEM look like and lowering the barrier to entry in scientific fields. 

Mentorship
----------

**Geoscience Education Mentorship & Support (GEMS)**

As of September 2023, Miah became a mentor for the [Geoscience Education Mentorship & Support](https://gems-program.org/) (GEMS) program. This prorgam matches undergraduate and early-stage graduate students with senior graduate students, postdocs, researchers, staff, or faculty to offer guidance on the graduate school application process, grant and fellowship applications, and the graduate school journey as a whole. Miah has helped two students through this program apply to graduate school and apply for fellowships and she believes that as a mentor, providing ample resources and support, is critical for demystifying the graduate school process and making acadmeia a more inclusive environment.

**Joint Program Applicant Support & Knowledgebase (JP-ASK)**

In September 2023, Miah became a mentor for the [Joint Program Applicant Support & Knowledgebase](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/apply/jp-applicant-support-knowledgebase-jp-ask/) (JP-ASK) progam at WHOI. This program pairs current graduate students and prospective students to help prospective students with the application process as well as offer insight to life as a graduate student at WHOI. Miah has mentored two students through this program by helping them find potential advisors ad connecting them with members of the lab of interest, reviewing application material, finding external funding oppurtunities, and chatting about the pros and cons of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. Since Miah did not know about this program when she applied to WHOI, she wants to particpate and spread the word about this amazing resource for prospective students!
